 /**
 * Notes about using this file
 *
 *	The capabilities defined here are only read (and copied into the Moodle database) when the SWTC LMS local
 *		plugin module is installed or upgraded. So every time you edit the db/access.php file you must:
 *		Increase the plugin's version number by editing the file local/swtc/version.php.
 *		Go to the the Administration â–º Notifications page, and click through the steps to let Moodle
 *			upgrade itself. You should see the name of your module (swtc) in one of the steps.
