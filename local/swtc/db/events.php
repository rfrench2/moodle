 * History:
 *
 * 10/17/20 - Initial writing.
 * 02/23/21 - Removed a few events and cleaned up.

 * Notes about using this file
 *
 *    The messages that are captured here are routed to the method (callback) in the php file listed (includefile).
 *    Important! The event that is being captured has already happened. For example, for user_loggedin,
 *    the user has already been logged into the SWTC LMS site.
 *            user_created event happens when a new userid is created.
 *            user_updated event happens when an existing user's profile is updated.
 *            user_loggedin event happens when an existing user logs into the site.
 *            course_viewed event happens when a user views a course.
 *            user_enrolment_created event happens when a user is enrolled in a course.
 *          course_updated  event happens when a course is updated for any reason.
 *
 * The following is copied from https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Event_2#Event_observers
 *      Event observers
 *          Observers are described in db/events.php in the array $observers, the array is not
 *               indexed and contains a list of observers defined as an array with the following
 *               properties:
 *                   eventname â€“ fully qualified event class name or "*" indicating all events, ex.:
 *                       \plugintype_pluginname\event\something_happened.
 *                   callback - PHP callable type.
 *                   includefile - optional. File to be included before calling the observer. Path relative
 *                      to dirroot.
 *                   priority - optional. Defaults to 0. Observers with higher priority are notified first.
 *                   internal - optional. Defaults to true. Non-internal observers are not called during
 *                          database transactions, but instead after a successful commit of the transaction.
