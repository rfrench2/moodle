/**
 * This is a callback method with a special naming convention that is searched for
 * by the Moodle File API.
 *
 * See link below for further information.  At the time of writing, note that the example in the link
 * isn't used exactly as is, as it wouldn't work and it is an old example.
 * Main things that are different are the use of send_stored_file instead (correct one to use in later versions of Moodle)
 * and not using the File API get_file() method.  It justs uses get_file_by_hash() (file_storage class in core) instead.
 *
 * Also refer to other plugins to get an idea how these kind of methods work (a good one is the mod forum plugin).
